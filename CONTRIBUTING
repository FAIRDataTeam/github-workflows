## Releases

Releases follow [semantic versioning].
Releases (and release tags) should be created via Github.
Also make sure to update the *major version* tag after creating a new release.
This can be done via the command line, for example:

```bash
git tag -a v1 -f
git push --tags -f
```

with `-a` (annotated) and `-f` (force).

This overrides the existing `v1` tag and keeps the original message.

TODO: The major version tag update could also be automated via another workflow.
